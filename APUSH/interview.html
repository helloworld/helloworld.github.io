            <h2>Interview with our resident expert Alphonse

<p>Interviewer: Hello there sir how is it going on this fine, fine day?

<p>Alphonse: After many years of hardship the dust has finally settled indeed it is a fine day.

<p>Interviewer: Hardships? Would you like to expand on that?

<p>Alphonse: We’ve been attempting to settle for nigh a century now and imagine the feeling of failure after failure…we’re just simple men trying to raise the world to the standard of the French.

<p>Interviewer: You never really answered my question Alphonse. On a side note can I call you Al, Alphonse is kind of a mouthful to say.

<p>Alphonse: NO NO NO NO NO my mommy named me Alphonse now deal with it you ignorant reporter *tears hair from head* 

<p>Interviewer: Calm Alphonse calm…

<p>Alphonse: *breathes deeply* sorry it’s a sensitive subject, my name is all I have left of my mother. As I was saying we went <p>through some hardships mainly failed colonies. 

<p>Interviewer: Could you tell me where and how it happened?

<p>Alphonse: Sure… give me a minute…….So in Jacksonville, Florida we attempted to start up a small colony. Little did we know it was Spanish territory and they sent troops who decimated our colony and left us straggling for life

<p>Interviewer: Was this the only colony failure?

<p>Alphonse: We had a spree of failures starting with Quebec which is now firmly established. When we first started Quebec it was a massive failure dying out in simply a year, but now we’ve adapted.

<p>Interviewer: Following with my trend of making you be more specific about everything how did you adapt?

<p>Alphonse: The biggest thing we did was an imitation of our homeland. Back at France when we start new colonies we have a certain style of sustainable housing and grow certain crops. 

<p>Interviewer: So it was just new housing or was there more?

<p>Alphonse: So as most colonies that are sponsored by their nation the purpose of our colonies was not emancipation rather profit, so we built a good relationship with the Native Americans and this led us to some important discoveries and very effective transfers of knowledge.

<p>Interviewer: *sigh* just make your responses longer so I don’t have to keep asking why or how something happened, got it?

<p>Alphonse: So mainly unlike the English, Portuguese and Spaniards we didn’t take to war right away with our American Indian neighbors. We fostered an era of peace and even fought by them in the Seven Years War. They helped us and we never turned our back on them, they’re humans just like us!

<p>Interviewer: That’s an interesting point of view how did that really help after they’d given you all their knowledge?

<p>Alphonse: The converts to the true religion were freer and truer then the American Indians held at gunpoint forced to surrender.

<p>Interviewer: So let’s move back how did you interact with your government?

<p>Alphonse: We had a good standing relationship which faltered a few times due to our colonies ehh being eradicated, but in general we exported many pelts and even some crops which were highly sought out. We also didn’t cost them loads of gold in waging constant war on the American Indians which helped us. 

<p>Interviewer: You guys seem to run a tight “colonial” ship here and have worked out the kinks, so how is the New World do you like it? 

<p>Alphonse: It’s a lot less homey then we would have preferred, but with some education about the terrain we settled at the mouth of the Mississipi and used this to our advantage. Maybe we didn’t find the passage to the East by going West, but we found land and claimed it all for the superior nation FRANCE!!!

<p>Interviewer: With that I think we’ll conclude our interview please and thank you!

<p>Interviewer: Thank you for being such a sporting interviewee Alphonse I shall remember you forever and always!

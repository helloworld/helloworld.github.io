            <blockquote>Q: "Why do us French have such a friendly relationship with the Indians?"</blockquote>
            <small>- Jourdain Leroy</small>

            <p>We were definitely very friendly with the Natives during our time in North America. Our relationship with the Natives was much less violent then the relationships of the English and the Spanish futher south. Rather then fighting, we engaged in a mutual gain relationship.</p>
<p>
             Land is not what we wanted. Rather, we had come for the Fur Trade. We had settled along the St. Lawrence River and the interior. This is where we constructed a few forts and trading posts. Most of us were traders and Jesiut Priests, making up a small number of just 3,000 people who were mostly men. The Natives and us French had common trading interests, which futhered our good-natured relationship. </p>

             <p> Many of us even engaged in relationships with the Native women. This caused a tighter bond between the French and the Natives. The goals of the Jesuit Priests were also much more modest as well. They didnt require the Natives to abandon their old practices and traditions </p> 
                
            <blockquote>Q: "What did we trade with the Natives? How did this directly impact relations?"</blockquote>
                        <small>- Libert Le Guen</small>


            <p>Our trade system with the Natives greatly impacted our firendly relationship. The Natives had done most of the work that required skills of training unique to the land of the New World. They tracked animals, trapped them using unique skills, and transported the skins to us French. In return, we gave them textiles, weapons, and metal tools. </p>

            <p>This trade caused us to be greatly dependent on eachother. Us French got what they wanted, and the Natives used their unique skills to recieve great profits on their efforts. Along with the trade of goods, many skills unique to our respective homelands were taught and learned. This increased our knowledge and had great value equivalent to all the goods we have traded </p>

            <blockquote>Q: "How did the relationship we had grew with the Indians help us in the future?"</blockquote>
            <small>- Max Guillaud</small>

            <p>A direct impact of our relationship with the Natives was their allianced during the French and Indian war.</p>

            <p>The most reliable Natives were the "domesticated" Indians. They had converted religion and settled with us, and were very helpful during the war. Indians groups such as the Potawatomis, Ojibwas, Ottawas would hold ground on newly conqured territory and coule be relied on to defend it rather then return home. The strength of relationship allowed us to use their help and allowed us to trust them in doing their job.</p> 

            <p>Next, the Delawares and Shawnees were important allies, but they had reluctantly agreed to ally. The Ohio Indians, fearing defeat and disliking the harsh treatment of the English, had also joined us in our fight.<p>

            <p> Our relationship allowed us to count on the Natives in a time of great need.</p>
